What did I do today?

- Today I've started creating a Github Repo and began Working on Level 1.

Did I have Problems and how could I solve them?

- We had a tiny problem with setting up the Github Repo, but we solved after a quick discussion.

What is my plan for the next week?

- I want to finish most of Level 1 and maybe start with Level 2.
